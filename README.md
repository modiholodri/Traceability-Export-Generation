# Export Traceability User Manual

## General

The purpose of this document is to describe the production of a traceability matrix generated for a requirements system, using the Doors script Para Export Traceability. Para Export Traceability produces a rich text file, which can be opened with MS Word or a similar application. This document targets requirements engineers, who are writing requirements specifications and have to export module traceability matrixes, Doors administrators, who have to produce a system-wide traceability matrix, and readers of the traceability matrix.

Para Export Traceability can be downloaded from the GitHub repository [https://github.com/modiholodri/Traceability-Export-Generation](https://github.com/modiholodri/Traceability-Export-Generation).

| Base Module                  | The module for which the module traceability matrix is created.                                                                                 |
| Base Object                  | An object in the base module.                                                                                                                   |
| Base System                  | The requirements system for which a system traceability matrix is generated.                                                                    |
| Involved Modules             | All Doors modules that are linked to the module within the defined levels and conditions, for which the module traceability matrix is produced. |
| Module                       | A Doors module, which can be a requirements specification, a test specification, a test record or basically any module.                         |
| Module Traceability Matrix   | The traceability matrix for a requirements module.                                                                                              |
| Object                       | A Doors object.                                                                                                                                 |
| Requirements System          | The sum of all requirements specifications for a product, including test specifications and test records.                                       |
| System Traceability Matrix   | The complete traceability matrix for a requirements system.                                                                                     |
| System Traceability Overview | An umbrella document combining all module traceability matrixes and descriptions.                                                               |
| Traceability Export          | The part of a Module Traceability Matrix, which is generated by the script Para Export Traceability.                                            |

### Requirements System Traceability

A requirements system includes all modules of a project, starting from the customer requirements down to the test records. All relevant modules should be frozen in a baseline set before the traceability matrix is generated. The complete traceability matrix consists out of this document, the system traceability overview document, and separate module traceability matrixes for each requirements module.

#### Export Traceability User Manual

This document explains how the whole system works together, how the traceability matrixes should be read, and how they are generated.

#### System Traceability Overview

The system traceability overview document contains a reference to this document, references to all involved module traceability matrixes, a module structure overview drawings, and product specific information concerning the module traceability matrixes.

#### Module Traceability Matrixes

A separate module traceability matrix is generated for each requirements module. A module traceability matrix consists out a short introduction and the generated traceability export from Para Export Traceability.
