# Traceability Set Generation

A traceability set contains the Para Export Traceability User Manual, the Traceability System Overview, and the Module Traceability Matrixes.

## Traceability System Overview

Fill in the front page and the history. Update references and the module overview drawing.

## Module Traceability Matrix

The file name of a module traceability matrix is a combination of the Project abbreviation, MTM, and the Doors module name, for example, BSP MTM AD\_SRS for Bangkok Skytrain Projects Module Traceability Matrix Application Design System Requirements Specification.

Fill in the front page and the history. The module name on the front page is a combination of the Doors modules name, the Doors Version and the Doors baseline suffix or the word Current, for example, AD\_SRS 3.1 (BPS RS 2011-06-01).

The recommended settings for a requirements module are 1 level out and 1 level in with the next level module objects included for test cases. The SIL and the Status attribute should be added to the Identifier. Duplicated objects should be marked and suspect links shown. Passed test results should be colored green and failed ones red. The object number should not be shown for levels below zero. The paper format should be Portrait A4. The objects should not be separated. The reference font size should be 18 and the indent 100.

After the export, open the Para Traceability Export for each module with Word Pad and use copy and paste to transfer the complete content in the last Paragraph of the Para Export Traceability Module Template.
